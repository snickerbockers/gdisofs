                              gdisofs

Usage:
    
    gdisofs [<options>] <gdi_file> <mountpoint> [<FUSE library options>]
    
mounts image, while fusermount shipped with FUSE library can be used to unmount:

    fusermount -u <mountpoint>

fuseiso options are:

    -p              Maintain mountpoint. Create it if it does not exists on
                    start, delete it on exit.

    -n              Do NOT maintain ~/.mtab.fuseiso . This file have format of
                    /etc/mtab and normally stores information about currently
                    mounted iso images.

    -c iocharset    Specify iocharset to use. Joliet filesystem store filenames
                    in unicode and to show them properly they need to be
                    converted to local charset. Default charset is a current
                    locale charset.

gdisofs supports Sega GD-ROM images consisting of a directory containing data
and audio tracks ripped from a GD-ROM and a .gdi file containing metadata
describing how those tracks are layed out on the physical disc.

Currently only Sega Dreamcast games using the 3-track format are supported.
