        * all: Fixed race-condition with find -- display stable inode numbers on mounted filesystem to the outside world. Added check/addition for library option "use_ino" -- required from now. isofs_real_init() split into two parts to make real initialization/error checking before giving control to libfuse.

        * all: Several options added to maintain mount point (create if it does not exists, delete on exit), do NOT maintain file ~/.mtab.fuseiso (with format of /etc/mtab), specify iocharset (default iocharset is now locale-specific).

        * all: Added support to mounting NRG-image files created by Nero software.

2006-09-25
